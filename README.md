## Overview
Travelling through flights has become an integral part of todayâ€™s lifestyle as more and more people are opting for faster travelling options. For the calculation of flight ticket fares, airlines now employ complicated strategies. Because the pricing fluctuates dynamically, this highly intricate system makes it impossible for customers to estimate the flight ticket fare. This project aims to predict travel prices using regression-based Machine Learning algorithms and to assist consumers in finding the best time and pricing to book flights.
